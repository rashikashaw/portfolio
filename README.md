# Portfolio monorepo

This is a hub of my personal projects and packages.

## What's inside?
Apps are located in `apps/` directory and packages are located in `packages/` directory.
Click the below links to open the deployed apps.
### Apps and Packages

- [`evo-gym`](https://portfolio-storybook.netlify.app): A simple fitness center website developed using React and Tailwind and deployed using Netlify.
- `self-made`: Under contruction e-commerce web sites for creative home crafts using React and Redux with APIs using Firebase.
- [`component-stories`](https://portfolio-storybook.netlify.app): Storybook for shared components, hooks, design system and helper utilites. Hosted using Netlify.

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
